<div class="content"> The objective is to forecast the electricity generation in the UK using different machine learning algorithms. The data are coming
 from the following sources (<a href="https://www2.bmreports.com/bmrs/?q=generation/fueltype/current">GenerationData</a>,
<a href="https://www2.bmreports.com/bmrs/?q=generation/tempraturedata">TemperatureData</a>). Data range from 23/02/2015 to 13/06/2019. The problem to 
solve here is a regression problem where the electricity generation, in MW, needs to be predicted. Three machine learning algorithms will be developed and 
compared: decision tree, random forest, and neural network. Google Colab had been used as framework where a Python script has been created to pre-process
the data, build the model and perform the analysis. The visualisation are done with the package Plotly.
